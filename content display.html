Pastries are baked goods made from a dough of flour, fat, and water, often with sugar and other flavorings, and include
sweet and savory items like pies, tarts, croissants, and Ã©clairs. Different types of pastry doughs, such as shortcrust,
puff, and choux, are distinguished by how fat is incorporated, creating textures from flaky to tender.
